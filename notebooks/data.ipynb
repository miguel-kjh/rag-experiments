       "Column([\"A:In Kentucky, your situation raises questions about patient rights and medical records access. If you were discharged from a pain management office and subsequently lost access to your patient portal, it's important to understand your rights regarding medical records. Under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), you have the right to access your own medical records. A healthcare provider cannot deny you access to your records, even if you were discharged from their practice. The issue with the patient portal could be a technical glitch or a deliberate action, but either way, it needs to be addressed. You should contact the pain management office directly to inquire about the issue with the patient portal. They are obligated to provide you with a way to access your medical records, which may include providing paper copies or access through a different electronic means. If the office is unresponsive or refuses to provide access to your records, consider speaking to a lawyer who is knowledgeable in health care law. They can guide you on how to enforce your rights to access your medical records and address any potential legal violations by the healthcare provider. Remember, your right to access your medical records is protected by law, and any obstacles to this access should be promptly addressed.\", \"A:If your houseboat was moved without your permission and you were asked to leave the property after 16 months without any notices, and the management has placed a lien on your houseboat and is attempting to sell it, you may have legal options to challenge their actions. First, you may want to consult with an attorney who specializes in property law or landlord-tenant law to review your case and provide guidance on your legal rights and options. It may also be helpful to gather any evidence you have, such as receipts or documentation of payments or communications with the management, to support your case. Some potential legal claims you may have against the management include breach of contract, conversion, or wrongful eviction. These claims may allow you to seek damages or other forms of relief, such as the return of your houseboat or compensation for any losses you have suffered. It's important to act quickly, as there may be deadlines or other requirements for filing a legal claim. An attorney can provide guidance on the best course of action and help you navigate the legal process.\", \"A:Yes, you can sue a dealership if you have had to replace your transmission 2 times within a year. Whether you will be successful depends on the facts and your presentation. You don't mention anything about any written agreements. Allowing an attorney to evaluate, organize and draft your conciliation or (small claims) complaint (up to $15,000) would be a wise investment. A well polished complaint will not only provide the judge a solid foundation to rule in your favor, but a detailed outline on which to base your oral argument. It would provide you a distinct advantage over the opposing party. The fees can be reasonable depending on the attorney.\", 'A:Once all parties have moved to another state, it is generally possible to register the order in the state where the child is now residing. Generally you need court permission to move a child out of state once a custody order has been entered (at least in Nebraska). If that did not happen before the move, then it can make matters more complicated.', 'A:It\\'s difficult to determine whether there is potential for a lawsuit without more information. Generally, the key question in cases involving trademarks is whether there is a likelihood of confusion between the marks. This analysis involves considering a number of factors, such as the similarity of the marks, the similarity of the goods or services, the sophistication of the consumers, and the strength of the senior user\\'s mark. Based on the limited information provided, it seems that there may be some potential for confusion between \"Rolemaster\" and \"Raid Master,\" particularly given that they both contain the suffix \"Master.\" However, the fact that the games have different themes and mechanics may weigh against a finding of likelihood of confusion. If you are concerned about potential trademark issues, it may be a good idea to consult with an intellectual property attorney who can provide more tailored advice based on the specifics of your situation.'])"

      "I was wondering if a pain management office is acting illegally/did an illegal action.. I was discharged as a patient from a pain management office after them telling me that a previous pain management specialist I saw administered a steroid shot wrong and I told them in the portal that I spoke to lawyers for advice but no lawsuit/case was created. It was maybe 1-2 months after I was discharged that I no longer have access to my patient portal with them. Every time I try to login I enter my credentials, wait a few seconds, and then I get re-directed back to the original screen where I have various options to login. I know I can speak to the office directly and ask them about what specifically is going on, talk to other lawyers if this is a violation of my rights, etc. but I was just wondering if anyone on this site would know if this action is in fact illegal.\n",
