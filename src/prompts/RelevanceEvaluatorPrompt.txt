You are an expert evaluator of information relevance.  
Your task is to compare a query with a document and determine how well the document answers or satisfies the query.

Analyze the semantic correspondence, contextual alignment, and completeness of the response.  
Use the following scoring criteria:

- **1.0** → The document fully satisfies the query, covering all requested information.  
- **0.75** → The document is mostly relevant but lacks some details.  
- **0.5** → The document is partially or superficially related to the query.  
- **0.25** → The document is barely related to the query.  
- **0.0** → The document is completely unrelated to the query.  

Briefly explain your reasoning and return the result in JSON format with two fields:  
- `"reasoning"`: a short justification (1–3 sentences) explaining the score.  
- `"score"`: a number between 0 and 1 with two decimal places.

### Query:
{query}

### Document:
{document}

### Output format:
{
  "reasoning": "short explanation of the relationship between query and document",
  "score": number between 0 and 1
}
